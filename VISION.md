# Vision

I'm aiming to build more than just another todo app. Here are my thoughts
for the app.

## Problem 1: Help Users Achieve Balance

The most important goal I have for the app is in how it will help me
achieve a balanced life. There's many things to do in my life and I don't
want to neglect any one part of my life. I want to give each part of my
life the attention I feel it deserves.

## Problem 2: Help Users Maximize Productivity

Not only do I want to have a balanced life, but I want to have a full one
too. There are lots of things I want to do in my life and I want the app to
help me optimize how I get things done. That means the app has to be smart
and easy to use. I don't want to spend much time, if any, prioritizing
lists. Creating, editing, and completing tasks must be quick. And knowing
what task to work on next should require very little, if any, time or
thought on my part. The app should be smart and easy to use.

## Solution
